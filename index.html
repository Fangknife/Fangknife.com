    Synchromy (1971) by Norman McLaren
    <a href="https://www.nfb.ca/film/synchromie/">[ Video Link ]</a> <br />
    Thing I remember from Cooper. So delightful. Entirely. They Dance I feel Alive!!!
    <p></p>

    Blue (1993) by Derek Jarman
    <a href="https://archive.org/details/blue-derek-jarman-1993">[ Video Link ]</a> <br>
    Another thing from Cooper. The teacher for the Color class liked showing very long
    videos where nothing happened, maybe just the sunlight moved.

    The Pale King (2011) by David Foster Wallace (book) <br />
    First book I've finished in a while. Absolutley entrancing, why would you ever think that would
    be intresting. Assuring to know you can write like that, sort of like the way I do. It's written exactly
    as someone talking. Completley correct about the minutia.

    Paprika (2006) and Perfect Blue (1997) by Satoshi Kon (movies) <br />
    I was watching these waiting to hear back about the transfer decision. I think it was really horrid,
    mid-summer, and it was just heat.
    Scene with the song, described as the dream of someone a severely delusional manic;

    Don Hertzfeldt (the dude)
    <a href="http://www.bitterfilms.com/forum.html">[ Blog Link ]</a> <br />
    I can't watch a lot of movies because I feel too much towards them and it hurts, I really love him,
    he's correct about this too.

    Light reading-
    <a href="https://discordia.loveshade.org/main.html">[ Site Link ]</a> and
    <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tilt/principia/body.html">[ Principa Discordia ]</a>. <br />
    I keep this as backup in case the "fear and repent" skews me Catholic.
    Need to angle it somewhere.

    I need to read through it all, and I feel like you would understand the patience.

    Critter who snuck up on me, I found him in my pocket.

    Forever grateful to him- teacher I've had for years.

    Piece by Mira Lee I saw at the Carnegie international-
    <a href="https://carnegieart.org/people/mire-lee/">[ Piece Link ]</a> and
    <a href="http://www.mirelee.com/en/works/carriers">[ Artist's Site ]</a>. <br />
    I think it was my favorite there. You really know so much that body = feminine and feminine means viscera,
    I think in that order. When we are in the future we'll only be our meat- I thought about her again
    because I clicked on something by Stelarc
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bi1YF90VG60&ab_channel=stelarcvideo">[ Piece Link ]</a> and
    <a href="http://stelarc.org/video.php">[ Artist's Site ]</a>. I was thinking about the Drawing With Machines class
    I'm going to take, and that I've spent enough time on sewing machine I should know what this means.

    Pro-healing, anti-psych-industry. At least to check to find a reference to a more specific person's work.
    Important to know the difference in those two.<br />
    And a MDD fourm for anyone who might want to read more from others with it. Otherwise try the discords

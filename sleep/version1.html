    Hi- web display version of the sleep charts because why not. Wanted them formatted similar and this seems like a fun toy.
    Doesn't do much, but I managed to get PyScript working.
    Sorry if the date picker isn't compatable- or it's ugly- html input/form elements don't have great css. Here's something fun:
    tried to get a slider working to scroll through dates like the physComp project- fun fact!!! If you use pyscript on a html
    type="slider" element, it wanted to register py-input, not py-change like the other inputs, and I could just Not get that value
    to pass to the python script! So I was looking at pyodide, but too much issue just for a slider. You can get kind of
    the same effect by holding an arrow key down in the number input. Other option's panel, which has like a lot of really good components,
    and I could get it working, but it makes things take forever to load. I just wanted a fucking slider.

    hidden comment because I just want the page to look clean & this doesn't matter lol
    -->
